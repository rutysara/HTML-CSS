        <h2>External Links</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>External Links:</strong> hyperlinks that point to web pages or resources located outside the current website. They are created using the <strong>`A` (anchor)</strong> element and have an `href` attribute specifying the URL of the external page or resource. <br>

                Targets: The `target` attribute in HTML specifies where the linked content should open when clicked. Common values include `_blank` (opens in a new browser tab or window) and `_self` (opens in the same tab or window). <br>
            
                Rel Attribute: The `rel` attribute in HTML provides additional information about the relationship between the current document and the linked document. For external links, the `rel` attribute can include values like "nofollow" (indicates search engines shouldn't follow the link) or "noopener" (enhances security when opening links in a new tab)
