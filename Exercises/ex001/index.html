    <h1>Notes on Website Construction</h1>
    <h2>Gustavo Guanabara</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p> This is my 5th attempt for a website construction heheheh. But in  my defence, this part 5 is because I am using my dad's macbook to study while at work!</p>
    <p> I am trying to get skills that will broad my prospectus of career growth. For example:</p>
    <p> Web developer <br>
        Software developer <br>
        Project Management (SQL) <br>
        Etc.
    </p>
    <p>If I want to insert the more than and less than symbols in my test, I will have to use the symbols & l (less) t (than) and & g (greater) t (than), each followed by a ;. <br>
    For example: 3 &gt; 1 or 1 &lt; 3</p>
    <p>If I write &g t (all together) even if not followed by a ; it will form the &gt sign hihi</p>
    <p>Typing & NonBreakingSpace will allow me to create a blank space - especially useful for the beginning of a paragraph for example!</p>
    <p>&NonBreakingSpace; This is an example!!</p>
        <!-- Coments that will not show in the webpage -->
        <p>If I want to make a lot of paragraph SPACES, it is not good to add a lot of &lt;br&gt; as it is very unprofessional. There is a better way to do that.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Special Symbols</h3>
        &reg;<br>
        &copy;<br>
        &trade;<br>
        &euro;<br>
        &pound;<br>
        &delta;<br>
        &Delta;<br>
        &uparrow;<br>
        &downarrow;<br>
        &leftarrow;<br>
        &rightarrow;<br>
        &upuparrows;<br>
        &gamma;<br>
        <p>&NonBreakingSpace;Everytime I want to add a symbol jut type & and more or less the description of the symbol and it the program will show you options.</p>
        <p>&NonBreakingSpace;Now EMOJI TIME! - Go to https://prod.emojipedia.org/</p>
        <p>&NonBreakingSpace;1. Simply copy&paste ðŸ˜Š, but sometimes it does not work in some browsers.</p>
        <p>&NonBreakingSpace;2. Find U+ emoji code. Type &. Then #. Then x. Add code. Type ;. Enter = &#x1F60A;</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Tagging images in HTML5</h3>
        <p>Choose an image and save it into the same folder as your website. <br>
        Then, type img in the program and the image tag will appear.</p>
        <img src="Rutysara.jpeg" alt="Rutysara">
        <p>We can also load images in sub-folders - it must still be inside the main webpage folder!
            <br>In this case, just create a sub-folder "images" for example and add to src. It will be represented as src="images/something" and on and on. 
            <br>You get the idea.</p>
        <p>To load images from external sources it is similar. You just need to copy the image address.</p>
        <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E03AQEzjiByKmMoOg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1688816055157?e=1694649600&v=beta&t=w0ogw3jXmkm1uXJTl5rzHPyUpSGFGlj0ccczL3VGe40" alt="Rutysara">
        <p>However, if the external source is altered or deleted I suppose it will affect my website too. So best to have it downloaded.</p> <!--URL from LINKEDIN-->
        <p>I still need to study about image types, quality and copyright. I will make sure to listen and study this on the way home today and tomorrow make some notes and read the pdf of the lesson on these topics.</p>
